<p>You see that guy over there? Giving talks to hundreds of college students on Web Development
and Security, pretty sweet right? Well that&#39;s me, and here&#39;s the story about how I got there and
who I am.</p>
<p>My real name is Sahil Shukla, I am a programmer by profession, part time bug bounty hunter and co-founder
of <a href="https://techpolygon.tk">Techpolygon</a>, a Web Design, Development, SEO, all the nine yards,
company. I started programming at the age of 16, when one of my friends <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahulaakash26/">Rahul</a>, got me into C programming, that&#39;s
when I decided to become a full time Python programmer becuase fuck C. I started learning about web
development as it was much easier and instantly gratifying. Thats when I started creating <strong>facebook
login</strong> look alikes and started reading up on <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phishing">Phishing</a> after getting a couple of passwords
from my friends, I decided to explore realm of <em>&quot;Hacking&quot;. </em>So just like everyone else
I downloaded <a href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux</a>, set that baby up, and started using all the
tools I could get my hands on. It was fun for a while but not very rewarding as I quickly realized that
I was pushing towards my journey of becoming a script-kiddie and not a Hacker.</p>
<p>After reading up a wonderfully written article on <a href="https://forum.bugcrowd.com/t/researcher-resources-how-to-become-a-bug-bounty-hunter/1102">How
to become a bug bounty hunter</a>, I decided to <a href="https://twitter.com/iamllamma">socialize</a> a little, got on twitter, followed a bunch
of legit hackers and reading up on books like <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Web-Application-Hackers-Handbook-Exploiting/dp/8126533404/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1549269696&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=web+application+hacker%27s+handbook">Web
Application Hackers Handbook 2</a>, which served vital role in getting me a good grounding in my
understanding of the web. Later I started trying my hands on actual targets, graciously provided by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/">BugCrowd</a> and <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/">Hackerone</a>,
so I started looking into it and it wasn&#39;t long when I found my first bug on Paytm. It was pretty
simple (<a href="https://llamasec.tk/posts/paytm-bug">here&#39;s the writeup</a>) but it made me
appreciate how just having the right hackers mindset you can start breaking professionally written web
applications, of multi billion dollar industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I was diving head first into this massive field that is Information Security, I developed a
particular affection towards reverse engineering, and due to my socialization on twitter, I found <a href="https://twitter.com/malwareunicorn?lang=en">Malware Unicorn</a> who had some wonderful
tutorials on <a href="https://sites.google.com/secured.org/malwareunicorn/reverse-engineering/re101?authuser=0">malwareunicorn.org</a>.
I still go through them and find new things everytime.</p>
<p>I still wouldn&#39;t consider myself a master at any of the afore mentioned skills, but I guess no one
does. So I hope you saw a little bit of yourself in me and would like to join me in the journey of
become the best there ever was. <a href="https://llamasec.tk/posts/">Here&#39;s where you can start.</a>
